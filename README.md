## Introduction
DavidShellManager is a C++ library built to streamline SSH profiles that heavily follows the Open/Closed principle. In practice, lets say you wanted to build an SSH session that takes inputs and outputs from a web interface, but outputs log data to a locally hosted database. These additions can easily be added to the shell manager through extension rather than modification.

## Setup
### About these design choices...
Alright, I will admit, I did get a little design pattern fever during this project and massively increased the complexity of what could have been a pretty simple project, a direct violation of the [KISS design principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).
